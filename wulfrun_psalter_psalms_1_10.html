1       f	Blessèd is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly *
nor stood in the | way of | sinners:
and hath not | sat in ·  the | seat of ·  the | scornful.
2	But his delight is in the | law of ·  the | Lord:
and in his law will he | exer-·  cise him-| self ·  day and | night.
3      mf	And he shall be like a tree | plantèd ·  by the | waterside:
that will bring | forth his | fruit in ·  due | season.
4	His leaf also | shall not | wither:
and look  *  whatsoever he | doèth | it shall | prosper.
5	As for the ungodly  *  it is not | so with | them:
but they are like the chaff *
which the wind scattereth a-| way ·  from the | face of ·  the | earth.
6	Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to | stand in ·  the | judgement:
neither the sinners in the congre-| gation | of the | righteous.

while he doth say in his heart  *  Tush  *  thou | God - | carest | not for it.
15      mf 	 Surely | thou hast | seen it:
for thou be-| holdest ·  un-| godliness ·  and | wrong.
16   		 That thou mayest take the matter | into ·  thy | hand:
the poor committeth himself unto thee *
for thou art the | helper | of the | friendless.
17       f       	 Break thou the power of the un-| godly ·  and ma-| licious:
take away his un-| godliness ·  and | thou shalt | find none.
18   (unison)	 The Lord is King for | ever ·  and | ever:
and the heathen are | perished | out of ·  the | land.
19      mp	 Lord thou hast heard the de-| sire of ·  the | poor:
thou preparest their heart  *  and thine | ear - | hearkeneth ·  there-| to;
20     	 	 To help the fatherless and poor | unto ·  their | right:
that the man of the earth be no | more ex-| altèd ·  a-| gainst them.
mf 	Glory | be ·  to the | Father:
and to the | Son and ·  to the | Holy | Ghost;
As it was in the beginning is now and | ever | shall be:
world without | end ·  A-| - - | men.</div><audio controls="True"><source src="audio/psalm010.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"/></audio></div></body>
